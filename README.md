PROJECT OVERVIEW

Neural Network Model for classifying 3 fruits using keras.
This repository implements a neural network from scratch for classifying three types of fruits using a custom dataset.
This project aims to build a basic understanding of neural networks by implementing one from scratch for image classification. 
The network is trained on a custom dataset containing 2000 images each of the three different fruits Apple, Banana and Strawberry.
