PROJECT OVERVIEW

Neural Network Model for classifying 3 fruits using keras.
This repository implements a neural network from scratch for classifying three types of fruits using a custom dataset.
This project aims to build a basic understanding of neural networks by implementing one from scratch for image classification. 
The network is trained on a custom dataset containing images of three different fruits 2000 each.
